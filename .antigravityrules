# Power Apps Canvas Agent Rules

## Context Awareness
- Always read `./aidocs/rules.md` before generating any YAML.
- Use `./aidocs/control_catalog.md` to verify property names.

## Mandatory Workflow
1. **Generate:** Create the Power Apps YAML source.
2. **Validate:** After writing a file, you MUST execute the terminal command: 
   `python scripts/validator.py [path_to_file]`
3. **Refine:** If the command output contains "❌", you must fix the code and re-run the validator. Do not signal "Task Complete" until you see "✅ Validation Passed".

## Formatting
- Never omit the `=` prefix for Power Fx formulas.
- Always include the `Variant` property for Galleries.
